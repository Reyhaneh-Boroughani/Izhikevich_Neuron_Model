# Izhikevich_Neuron_Model
 
Izhikevich model reproduces spiking and bursting behavior of known types of cortical neurons. The model combines the biologically plausibility of Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics and the computational efficiency of integrate-and-fire neurons.
The code simulates 20 different spiking and bursting behaviors.
